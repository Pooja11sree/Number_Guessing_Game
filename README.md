# Number_Guessing_Game
This is a simple console-based number guessing game written in Java. The game generates a random number between **1 and 100**, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback to guide the player.

## 📌 Features: 
- 🎲 Generates a random number using `Math.random()`
- 🧠 Takes user input with `Scanner`
- ✅ Validates input to ensure it's between 1 and 100
- 📈 Gives hints if the guess is too high or too low
- 🔢 Displays total number of attempts taken to guess correctly


## 📷 Sample Output: 
Guess a number between 1 and 100:
50
📉 Your guess is too low. Try again! (Guess count: 1)
75
📈 Your guess is too high. Try again! (Guess count: 2)
63
🎉 Correct guess!
✅ Total guesses = 3

## 📚 Concepts Used: 
- Java Basics (`int`, `if-else`, `while`)
- User Input (`Scanner`)
- Random Number Generation (`Math.random()`)
- Looping and Conditionals
